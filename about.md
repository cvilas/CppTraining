# Modern C++ Design Patterns
C++ On Sea, 13th July 2020

https://cpponsea.uk/2020/sessions/workshop_modern-cpp-design-patterns.html

## Objectives

- Learn how to replace inheritance hierarchies with values-based solutions in order to improve performance, code clarity and testability;
- Experience first hand how classic design patterns like visitor, strategy, observer and decorator have evolved in modern C++;
- Understand state of the art design patterns like type erasure and expression templates.

## Brief

Design patterns have proven to be useful over several decades and knowledge about them is still very useful to design robust, decoupled systems. Modern C++, however, has profoundly changed the way we use C++, think about design and implement solutions. This hands-on training explores modern C++ design and the modern forms of the classic design patterns. It provides guidelines, idioms and best practices for sustainable and maintainable design, which enable programmers to create professional, high-quality code. Amongst others it will answer the following questions:

- How does good C++ design with a minimum of dependencies look like?
- Why does classical C++ design based on inheritance hierarchies fail so often?
- What advantages does value semantics based design provide?
- How are the classic design patterns realised in modern C++?
- What are alternatives to the classic design patterns?

After this course, participants will 
- have an impression on the modern alternatives of classic design patterns;
- have gained knowledge about modern design techniques;
- understand how std::function, std::any, and ranges work; 
- avoid the usual pitfalls in the context of inheritance; 
- know about the importance of value semantics.
